At the Predictive Neuroscience Lab, Iâ€™m excited about contributing to our team's efforts in leveraging AI to tackle complex neuroscience challenges.

My research focuses on developing deep learning-based methods for harmonizing MRI data across different sites.
This harmonization process is designed to address batch effects â€” variations in data that arise from differences in scanner equipment or imaging protocols.
These batch effects can introduce significant biases into multi-site MRI studies, making it challenging to draw reliable conclusions from downstream analyses.
By mitigating these effects, we aim to enhance the generalizability and reproducibility of analysis findings in multi-site MRI studies.
